# Concord Authentication Bypass to RCE
This module focuses on the Concord workflow server, which contains three authentication bypass vulnerabilities. Initially using a greybox approach, the module explores a CORS misconfiguration leading to information disclosure, a CSRF vulnerability, and later, through a whitebox review, default user accounts accessible via undocumented API keys. These vulnerabilities are exploited to achieve remote code execution.

The module emphasizes how chaining vulnerabilities can bypass browser protections and demonstrates that even with improved browser security, weak configurations—like permissive CORS settings or default credentials—can still lead to full application compromise.
