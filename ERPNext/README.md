# ERPNext Authentication Bypass and Server Side Template Injection
This module explores two vulnerabilities in ERPNext, an open-source ERP system built on the Frappe framework. First, it examines an SQL injection that allows bypassing authentication to access the Administrator console. Then, it details a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability used to achieve remote code execution. The module concludes by highlighting how deviating from standard design patterns can aid in identifying such vulnerabilities.
