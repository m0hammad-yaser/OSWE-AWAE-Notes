# openITCOCKPIT XSS and OS Command Injection
openITCOCKPIT is an application that aids in the configuration and management of two popular monitoring utilities: Nagios and Naemon. The vendor offers both an open-source community version and an enterprise version with premium extensions.

Although the community version of openITCOCKPIT is open source, we'll take a black box approach in this module to initially exploit a cross-site scripting vulnerability. The complete exploit chain will ultimately lead to remote command execution (RCE).

These vulnerabilities were discovered by Offensive Security and are now referenced as **`CVE-2020-10788`**, **`CVE-2020-10789`**, and **`CVE-2020-10790`**.

## Application Discovery
To discover exposed endpoints, start by visiting the application's home page and noting all the endpoints it accesses. Don't overlook directories like images, CSS, or JavaScriptâ€”they may reveal valuable clues about the application's behavior, which can be useful during a black box assessment.
### Building a Sitemap
Let's visit `http://openitcockpit` in Firefox while proxying through BurpSuite to create a basic sitemap. The proxy will capture all the requests and resources that are loaded and display them in the `Target` > `Sitemap tab`.

**This initial connection reveals several things:**
- The vendor dependencies are stored in the `/lib` and `/vendor` directories.
- Application-specific JavaScript appears located in the `/js` directory.

Let's load a page that should not exist (like `/thispagedoesnotexist`) to determine the format of a `404` page.

The `404` page expands the Burp sitemap considerably. The `/js` directory is especially interesting.

Specifically, the `/js/vendor/UUID.js-4.0.3/` directory contains a `dist` subdirectory.

A successfully built JavaScript library usually outputs to a `dist` or `public` folder with minified, essential files. However, if the entire directory is included instead of just the necessary `.js` file, it may contain extra files that could increase the attack surface.
