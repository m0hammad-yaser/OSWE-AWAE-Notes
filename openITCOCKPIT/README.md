# openITCOCKPIT XSS and OS Command Injection
openITCOCKPIT is an application that aids in the configuration and management of two popular monitoring utilities: Nagios and Naemon. The vendor offers both an open-source community version and an enterprise version with premium extensions.

Although the community version of openITCOCKPIT is open source, we'll take a black box approach in this module to initially exploit a cross-site scripting vulnerability. The complete exploit chain will ultimately lead to remote command execution (RCE).

These vulnerabilities were discovered by Offensive Security and are now referenced as **`CVE-2020-10788`**, **`CVE-2020-10789`**, and **`CVE-2020-10790`**.
