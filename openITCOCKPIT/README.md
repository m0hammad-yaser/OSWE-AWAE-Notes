# openITCOCKPIT XSS and OS Command Injection
openITCOCKPIT is an application that aids in the configuration and management of two popular monitoring utilities: Nagios and Naemon. The vendor offers both an open-source community version and an enterprise version with premium extensions.

Although the community version of openITCOCKPIT is open source, we'll take a black box approach in this module to initially exploit a cross-site scripting vulnerability. The complete exploit chain will ultimately lead to remote command execution (RCE).

These vulnerabilities were discovered by Offensive Security and are now referenced as **`CVE-2020-10788`**, **`CVE-2020-10789`**, and **`CVE-2020-10790`**.

## Application Discovery
To discover exposed endpoints, start by visiting the application's home page and noting all the endpoints it accesses. Don't overlook directories like images, CSS, or JavaScriptâ€”they may reveal valuable clues about the application's behavior, which can be useful during a black box assessment.
### Building a Sitemap
Let's visit `http://openitcockpit` in Firefox while proxying through BurpSuite to create a basic sitemap. The proxy will capture all the requests and resources that are loaded and display them in the `Target` > `Sitemap tab`.

**This initial connection reveals several things:**
- The vendor dependencies are stored in the `/lib` and `/vendor` directories.
- Application-specific JavaScript appears located in the `/js` directory.

Let's load a page that should not exist (like `/thispagedoesnotexist`) to determine the format of a `404` page.

The `404` page expands the Burp sitemap considerably. The `/js` directory is especially interesting.

Specifically, the `/js/vendor/UUID.js-4.0.3/` directory contains a `dist` subdirectory.

A successfully built JavaScript library usually outputs to a `dist` or `public` folder with minified, essential files. However, if the entire directory is included instead of just the necessary `.js` file, it may contain extra files that could increase the attack surface.

For example, the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/LiosK/UUID.js) lists a root-level `README.md` file. Let's try to open that file on our target web server by navigating to `/js/vendor/UUID.js-4.0.3/README.md`

The response indicates that README.md exists and is accessible. Although the application is misconfigured to serve more files than necessary, this is only a minor vulnerability considering our goal of remote command execution. We are, however, expanding our view of the application's internal structure.

For example, the `[/docs/](https://github.com/LiosK/UUID.js/tree/master/docs)` directory seems to contain HTML files. These "supporting" files are generally considered great targets for XSS vulnerabilities. This avenue is worth further investigation.

### Targeted Discovery
We'll begin our targeted discovery by focussing on finding aditional libraries in the `/vendor` directory. By reviewing the *Sitemap*, we already know that five libraries exist: `UUID.js-4.0.3`, `fineuploader`, `gauge`, `gridstack`, and `lodash`.

In order to discover additional libraries, we could bruteforce the vendor directory with a tool like Gobuster. However, we'll avoid common wordlist like those included with DIRB. Since we are finding JavaScript libraries in the `/js/vendor` path, we'll instead generate a more-specific wordlist using the top ten thousand npm JavaScript packages.

Conveniently for us, the [nice-registry](https://github.com/nice-registry) repo contains a curated list of all [npm packages](https://github.com/nice-registry/all-the-package-repos).

We will use `names.json`, we can use `jq` to grab only the top 10000, filter only items that have a package name with grep, strip any extra characters with cut, and redirect the output to `npm-10000.txt`.
```bash
kali@kali:~$ jq '.[0:10000]' names.json | grep ","| cut -d'"' -f 2 > npm-10000.txt
```
